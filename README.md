POINT OF SALE - What do you mean POS?

A point of sale, or point of purchase, is where you ring up customers.
When customers check out online, walk up to your checkout counter, or pick out an item from your stand or booth, they're at the point of sale. 
Your point-of-sale system is the hardware and software that enable your business to make those sales.
